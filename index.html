    <h2><i>Apple Specilaist and College Student</i></h2>
                  <p>My Name is Daniela Armas, but my friends and family call me Dani. I currently work for Apple as an Apple Specialist. I work inside of a Best Buy store in their Apple Shop to help those costumers have the same experience as going to an Apple store to buy their desired products. Also, I am a college student on my 4th year, majoring in Computer Information Systems with a Concentration in Programming. I live with my girlfriend and two cats and I am the biggest fan of Golden Retrievers and German Shapers.</p>
